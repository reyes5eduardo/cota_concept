This is a personal project to try to reenvision the current Circuit of the Americas website. 
Being a huge F1 and motorsport fan I wanted to create something that I was passionate about and decided on my closest track. 
I wanted to simplify the current COTA website and give it a modern look and feel to it. 
As it currently stands this only showcases the main page of the site but I'm currently working on designing the other aspects 
as ticket checout page, events page, store page and experice page. 

The Figma files can be found on my personal site https://www.eduardoreyes.dev/projects.html
The original site is http://circuitoftheamericas.com 

This is just a personal project and not associated with The Circuit Of The Americas.
